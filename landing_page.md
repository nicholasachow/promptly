# Prompt engineering collection

**Beep boop bop ü§ñÔ∏è This page is currently under construction.**

This is a compendium of fun and interesting resources for learning about the wonderful world of prompt engineering (and hopefully more about LLMs too, but later).

üëàÔ∏è I've also created some related tools and resources that you can check out too:
* **Winning Writing x ChatGPT**: an introduction to prompt engineering presented to Glenn Kramon's GSB class Winning Writing.
* **Prompt compiler**: a tool to help you make better prompts.
